                <h2>What is NonPolar?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>NonPolar is a group of 5 University of Michigan undergraduate students committed to informing everyday citizens on trends in politics in a newsletter that is accurate, concise, and digestible.
                   The group is also looking to build relationships with student and local organizations to promote critical thinking and civil discourse.

                        <p>NonPolar distributes a newsletter for regular, everyday people. Today's media landscape is riddled with misinformation, inflammatory headlines, and corporations with their own incentives.
                            Our goal is to promote critical thinking and teach people the skills needed to be a well-informed individual, while making information digestible.

                        <p>None of our work would be possible without the Barger Leadership Institute (BLI).
                             The BLI provides classes and other programming centered around leadership through the college of Literature, Science, and Arts and the University of Michigan.
                             Each year, they fund a select group of projects through their Capstone Cohort to tackle complex problems. Find out more on their website here.</p>
